In this video we will be learning about sshd


This lab will require that you are connected to Seneca's VPN service on your windows c7host

Start c7host, centos1, centos2, centos3

$ sudo virsh start centos1
$ sudo virsh start centos2
$ sudo virsh start centos3

In c7host
Make a file in your home directory called myfile.txt that contains some text

$ ls > myfile.txt

*** Connect to VPN!!! ***

copy myfile.txt to your regular matrix account

$ scp myfile.txt brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca:~

scp copies files across a network securely tunneling through ssh

$ ssh brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca

Uses ssh to connect to a remote host and receive a remote terminal shell

We can also use ssh to run single command on the remote host instead of a interactive shell

$ ssh brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca ls ~
Note problem with local bash using ~
$ ssh brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca "ls ~"
or:
$ ssh brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca ls /home/brian.gray
$ ssh brian.gray@matrix.senecacollege.ca "cat ~/myfile.txt"

To establish an ssh connection you require an ssh service/daemon/server (sshd) installed on the remote host and an ssh client program installed on the local host. (ssh, scp, sftp)

In most linux installations both the ssh server and client are installed by default.
To check what packages were installed

$ rpm -qa | grep ssh

Both a client and a server is installed.
What packages were used?

openssh-server installs a service called sshd

$ sudo systemctl status sshd

What ports does the sshd service use?
$ ss -atunp
$ ss -atunp | grep sshd
$ ss -atup

grep ssh /etc/services

Confirm sshd is running on 3 VM's by establishing a connection
$ ssh bgray@centos1
$ ssh bgray@centos2
$ ssh ops245@centos3
