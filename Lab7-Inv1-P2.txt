Hackers know that port 22 is commonly open
They also know the root account name.

This makes ssh a target of attack, all that is required is the password.
Brute force attacks could be used.

2 things can make this harder
Use a non default port number for ssh
Disable root login over ssh

On centos1

open terminal 
su -

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

examine file

uncomment and set to no
#PermitRootLogin no

add
AllowUsers bgray

Restart sshd
systemctl restart sshd

On c7host
ssh root@centos1
ssh bgray@centos1

On centos1
useradd -m other
passwd other

on c7host
ssh other@centos1

on centos1
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
add other to AllowUsers

systemctl restart sshd

on c7host
ssh other@centos1
then
sudo ls /etc/
su -

less /var/log/secure
ssh connections logins
su usage
sudo usage

grep sudo: /var/log/secure
grep su: /var/log/secure
