Accessing Administrative priviliges
Discussion of su vs sudo
demo su and su -
whoami
less /var/log/anaconda/packaging.log
demo sudo

sudo less /var/log/secure
sudo access can be controlled and is not given to most users.
We selected "Make this user Administrator" when creating this account

anaconda is installation program it creates the packaging.log file to record what it installed 

use sudo and grep to find out how many packages were done
sudo grep -i packaging /var/log/anaconda/packaging.log | wc -l

Turning off SELinux

Security Enhanced Linux
Controls access of software beyond simple filesystem permissions. Not covered in this course

sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
set SELINUX to permissive
save file and reboot

to check status:
sestatus
getenforce

Perform software updates
Installed from DVD source but many updates have been released since that DVD image was created.

We need to install updates using a command call yum
YellowDog Update Manager

sudo yum update 

Periodically we should perform updates on all of our VM's to keep them in top shape.
If the kernel is updated then a reboot will be required

Old kernel will still be available in boot loader (grub) menu
