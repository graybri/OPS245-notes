Going to learn some bash commands that can be used to get information about the system.

Eventually we will learn to create scripts that can automate these commands to produce a system report
system administrators often document their system settings


try them both as your regular account and using sudo

make notes about what the commands produce as output

uname
uname -r
uname -v
uname -rv

hostname
ps

Discuss rpm
Redhat Package Manager
Maintains databas of information about installed software packages

Can be used install/update/remove software from the system usng package files
Package files contain all of the files required fo a particular piece of software and instruction where they are to be written.
Packages may also change some config settings on the system. package files .rpm contain those instructions.

Package files must be located and downloaded first and they may contain a list of dependancies that must be in place before installation. 

Debian based distros use a different packaging system called apt .deb files

rpm records information about packages installed into the rpm database.

We can also use the rpm command to query the database to get valuable information about the software packages installed on the system
Query with -q option
rpm -q gedit
rpm -q -a
rpm -q -a | wc -l
rpm -q -l gedit

rpm -q -a -l
rpm -q -a -l | wc -l

rpm -q -i gedit

Network configuration
ip is a powerfull command that can display network configuration info and also be used to modify netowrk settings.
network routing tables can also be seen

previously used iconfig and route commands
now deprecated but still included and working

ip address show
ip route show
show iconfig and route command
nslookup to test DNS
interactively or stand alone
nslookup
> server
?
> exit

nslookup server

nslookup
> www.senecacollege.ca
> exit

nslookup www.senecacollege.ca

We can script all of these commands with a bash script that produces a system report.
We can also create python scripts to do the same task.

In this course we will be learning some python scripting to automate our work.
In the meantime lets enter a bunch of bash commands to generate a report

mkdir ~/bin
cd bin
date +'%A %B %d, %Y (%I:%M %p)'
date +'%A %B %d, %Y (%I:%M %p)' > report.txt
echo >> report.txt
hostname >> report.txt
echo >> report.txt
uname -rv >> report.txt
echo >> report.txt
ps aux >> report.txt
echo >> report.txt
ip address show >> report.txt

You could additional echo commands to add headers and notes
