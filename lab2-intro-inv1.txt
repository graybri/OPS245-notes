Review enviornment
Installing KVM into c7host
INstalling 3 centos VM's in different configurations and using different installation methods
We will then learn to use the virsh command to manage our vitual machines
Then we will learn how to properly backup and restore VM images and VM configurations

We will then learn to create a python script that we can use to backup up our virtual machines

Investigation 1
In this investigation we will be installing KVM and configuring it to support nested VM's

Part 1
Log into c7host
Perform a system update

sudo yum update

Install the KVM virtualization software
sudo yum install qemu-kvm qemu-img virt-manager libvirt lib-virt-python \
libvirt-client virt-install virt-viewer bridge-utils

Reboot

This installed the qemu/kvm hypervisor, a new service called libvirtd that manages the VM's,
a GUI tool for working with the VM's and virsh a command line tool for working with the VM's

Start the libvirtd service
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd

Centos 7 installs a firewall service called firewalld we revert it back to the older and widely used iptables service.
systemctl is the command used to manage system services

sudo systemctl disable firewalld 
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo yum remove firewalld

sudo yum install iptables-services
sudo systemctl enable iptables
sudo systemctl start iptables

Run virt-manager as your regular user

Part 2
Now we have to edit the c7host boot configuration to support nested VM's

sudo vi /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg

Look for first occurance of the th linux kernel boot command (linuxefi) and insert the boot option kvm-intel.nested=1 after LANG

save and quit
reboot c7host

check it worked 
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
should output Y

conclude
