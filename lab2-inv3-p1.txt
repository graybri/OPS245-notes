In investigation 3 we will learn to manage our virtual machines.

Including backing them up, restoring them, and manipulating them from the command line

Shutdown the 3 VM's

sudo shutdown -h now

in c7host

sudo -i


Examine the contents of /var/lib/libvirt/images

mkdir ~bgray/backups

Notice use of redirection to make a compressed backup of disk image files
Depending on the size of the file this may take some time

gzip < centos1.qcow2 > ~bgray/backups/centos1.qcow2.gz
gzip < centos2.qcow2 > ~bgray/backups/centos2.qcow2.gz
gzip < centos3.qcow2 > ~bgray/backups/centos3.qcow2.gz

compare the size of backups to originals

ls -lh /var/lib/libvirt/images
ls -lh ~bgray/backups

exit to return to regular user

start centos3
login as ops245

wreck it
sudo rm -rf /*

shutdown and restart to see it is broken
force off

restore disk image
gunzip < ~bgray/backups/centos3.qcow2.gz > /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos3.qcow2

restart the VM

Also important to backup the VM definition/configuration

sudo virsh dumpxml centos3
sudo virsh dumpxml centos3 > ~bgray/backups/centos3.xml

This can be used later to restore the VM configuration in kvm.
We will see this done in Part 2
