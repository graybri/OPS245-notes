Part 2

In this video we will be covering the tasks in Lab4 investigation 1 Part 2
Which will involve creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts 

In centos1 

To add a user account we use the command useradd
and then set their initial password using the passwd command

man useradd

sudo useradd ops245_1
sudo passwd ops245_1

grep ops245_1 /etc/passwd
ls /home
Home directory was created automatically
Not all Linux systems will do this by default

explain -m

sudo useradd -m ops245_2
sudo passwd ops245_2

ls /home

To delete (remove) a user account we use the userdel command

sudo userdel ops245_2
grep ops245 /etc/passwd
ls /home
home dir not removed by default

sudo rm -rf /home/ops245_2

Use -r option to remove the users home directory at the same time.
sudo userdel -r ops245_1
ls /home

Recreate ops245_1 

sudo useradd -m ops245_1
sudo passwd ops245_1

sudo ls -a /home/ops245_1

Where do the initial contents of the users home directory come from?
What if we want add files and directories automatically to a new users home directory?

There is a directory that acts as a tenplate for a new users home directory.
ls -a /etc/skel

We can add to that template
sudo touch /etc/skel/foo
sudo mkdir /etc/skel/policies
sudo useradd -m ops245_2
sudo passwd ops245_2
ls -a /home/ops245_2

To create a user account that expires
man useradd 
look and explain -e

To modify users after created we can use the usermod and chage commands
man usermod
sudo usermod -c "New Name" ops245_2
grep "ops245" /etc/passwd

man chage
sudo chage -l ops245_1
sudo chage -E 2021-12-31 ops245_1
sudo chage -l ops245_1
