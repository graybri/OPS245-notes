Managing Groups

Groups are used to control permissions
Create a group and add members to the group
Assign permissions to the group
Prevents having to assign permisions to many individual users

In centos1


switch user in GUI to New Name
open terminal 
touch information.txt
ls -l 
who owns the file

sudo groupadd -g 5000 welcome
sudo fails

Switch user to bgray
sudo groupadd -g 5000 welcome
sudo groupadd -g 5001 secondary
cat /etc/group

man usermod 
look for -g option to change primary group
also -aG to add to secondary group

sudo usermod -g welcome ops245_1
sudo usermod -g welcome ops245_2
sudo usermod -aG secondary ops245_1
sudo usermod -aG secondary ops245_2
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/group
sudo ls -l /home/ops245_1

Switch to ops245_1
ls -l
chgrp secondary information.txt
ls -l


Practical Example

Management has sent you (the Linux systadmin) that a "new" employee has been hired and will be on on probation for 3 months. As the Linux system administrator, they want you to perform the following steps:



sudo useradd -m -e 2021-12-31 -g welcome noobie
sudo passwd noobie
sudo usermod -aG secondary noobie
sudo usermod -c "Really Green" noobie
cat /etc/group


Unfortunately, you were later informed that this "noobie" employee was caught stealing from the company. They want you to perform the following operations:

sudo userdel noobie
grep noobie /etc/passwd
ls /home
