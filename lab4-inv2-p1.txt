In this video we will be examining where our accounts ability to use sudo comes from

Recall that when we installed our VM's our initial regular account was made an administrator of the system because we checked the box

This setup our initial account to be able to use sudo to elevate our privileges to root run all commands on the system

sudo access is controlled by the file /etc/sudoers

on centos1

sudo less/etc/sudoers
/bgray 
not found

cat /etc/group
look for our account and ops245_1

Part of scondary group called wheel

sudo less /etc/sudoers

/wheel

%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

Lets create a new user account for ourselves on centos3 and give them sudo access by adding them to the wheel group

on centos3
login as ops245

sudo useradd -m bgray
sudo passwd bgray
sudo usermod -aG wheel bgray

cat /etc/group
logout 
login as bgray
sudo cat /etc/shadow
