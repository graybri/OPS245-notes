In this video we will learn to give access to using sudo to just run a few specific commands as the user root

This allows us to give limited admisinstrative access to certain users.
For example I could allow a user sudo access to commands to manage services but not to reconfigure our storage devices, networks, or administer user accounts.


On centos1

We can either edit /etc/sudoers directly or add files to /etc/sudoers.d

sudo vi /etc/sudoers won't work
instead use 
sudo visudo


Better practise is to create a file for a particular user in 
/etc/sudoers.d

Logout as bgray
Login as ops245_1


Open terminal
sudo systemctl restart sshd

exit
logout

Login as bgray
Open terminal
Create a new file in /etc/sudoers.d called ops245_1
and add the line
ops245_1 ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/systemctl

Exit
Logout
Login as ops245_1
Open terminal 
sudo systemctl restart sshd

Exit 
Logout

Login as bgray
Open terminal 
Lets add a file for ops245_2 that allows them to administer user accounts
(useradd passwd usermod userdel groupadd groupmod groupdel chage)
sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/ops245_2

Add line
ops245_2 ALL=(ALL) /sbin/useradd, /bin/passwd, /sbin/usermod, /sbin/userdel, /sbin/groupadd, /sbin/groupmod, /sbin/groupdel, /bin/chage
Save file

Exit 
Logout
Login as OPS245_2
Open terminal 
Test useradd and passwd
