In this video we will be learning to manage individual system services
We have previously performed these types of tasks when setiing up the iptables service


In general from a security pespective it is worth while examining the services running on our system on a normal basis.
Geneally you want to make sure that each service running is actually required and disable those that aren't
Each service running gives hackers a point of attack. 
Reducing services reduces points of attack.

We manage system services using the systemctl command

In centos1


sudo systemctl status iptables
sudo systemctl disable iptables
sudo systemctl stop iptables 
sudo systemctl status iptables

sudo systemctl enable iptables
sudo systemctl status iptables
sudo systemctl start iptables
