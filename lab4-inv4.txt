In this video I will be demonstrating how to take the interactive script that we created in Lab3 to archive a directory, and turn it in to a non interactive script that uses argparse to parse command line arguments to accomplish the same thing.

vi lab3.py 
Examine script to see what changes need to be made
We will need to remove all code that prompts for input
We will need to remove any loops that are used to validate user input


We will need to add argparse code to accept command line arguments in place of user input

Demo
./lab3.py

vi lab4.py
import argparse
instantiate the parser object adding a command description

Add positional arguments (required) for dirname and archname

Add a mutually exclusive group to accept an option for 1 of the 3 compression methods

If no option is supplied create the archive without compression
Check the Boolean value of the options to see which to use


demo

./lab4.py
See the options group
./lab4.py -h
./lab4.py ~/bin/tmp test
Creates archive with no compression
./lab4.py -b ~/bin/tmp test
Creates archive with bzip compression
