Lab 5

In this video we will learn to monitor disk space usage, which is a very important task for sysadmins.

We will create a script to help us and then schedule that script to run automatically using cron

We will then learn to manage our storage devices by resizing them, adding additional devices and adding them to our system.

Investigation 1 Part 1

sysadmins must monitor disk space usage on a regular basis  to make  sure that we don't suddenly run out of space on any of our devices which could cause the system to fail or application stall

Implications of running out of space. The OS requires some available space to function, temp files, logging etc.

In  centos2

$ df
$ df -h

Explain output

Note space usage for / and /home

Demo
As user
$ dd if=/dev/zero of =~/largefile bs=1024 count=1000000
$ ls -l ~

$ df -h
To investigate how much space is taken up in each users home directory we can use:

$ sudo du -hs /home
$ sudo du -ha ~bgray
$ sudo ls -l ~bgray

If space runs low we can reallocate space among devices or add additional storage devices.
We can also Investigate the cause of sudden increases in space usage.
These can include users activity, excessive logging, or potential intrusion or hacking activity

If users are consistently using too much space Linux has a quota system that can be enforced. (Not covered in this course)

We can also use the find command to locate very large files on the system.

$ sudo find / -size +100000k
$ ls -l /home/bgray
