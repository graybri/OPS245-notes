In this video I will be discussing Lab 5 Investigation 2- Part 1

We will managing and reconfiguring our storage on centos2 using Logical Volume Management (LVM) commands to do this

We will be learning to display LM information, adding space to a volume group from an existing storage device, and then increasing the size of a  Logical volume using some of that space.
We will then learn to reduce the size of a logical volume.

On centos2

Because we will be manipulating file storage, loss of data is possible.
So, it is a good idea to backup your centos2.qcow2 disk image and also the VM xml data
Also a good idea to do a yum update

$ sudo ls /dev/vd*
$ df -h

/dev/vda1 is mounted on the /boot directory.
The /boot directory is always mounted on a tradition partition because LVM is not available before the system is booted.

Remember that centos2 was installed as a "Minimal Installation" so we will need to install some additional tools.

$ sudo yum install system-storage-manager

This will install the ssm commands

$ sudo ssm list

We can see that there are 3 devices listed,
    /dev/vda
    /dev/vda1 (mounted directly on /boot)
    /dev/vda2 added to the VolumeGroup(storage pool) centos_centos2

1 VolumeGroup(storage pool) listed
centos_centos2

4 volumes listed including
/dev/vda1 (traditional partition mounted on /boot as xfs)
/dev/centos_centos2/root (logical volume mounted on / as ext4)
/dev/centos_centos2/swap (logical volume not mounted)
/dev/centos_centos2/home (logical volume mounted on /home as ext4)

Compare to the output of
df -h

The commands pvs vgs and lvs will show LVM information
sudo pvs
sudo vgs
sudo lvs

There are also the commands pvdisplay, vgdisplay and lvdisplay
sudo pvdisplay
sudo vgdisplay
sudo lvdisplay

$ sudo ssm list
Is there any free space on the Virtual Disk?

Lets take some of that available space and create a new partition
$ sudo fdisk /dev/vda

p to print partition table
n to create a new partition
p to create a primary partition
3 for next available partition number
enter to accept default starting block
+3G  to set ending block
p to print partition table
w to save changes and quit fdisk

The we need to reboot because usually the partition table for a device is read at boot time

$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/vda to confirm

$ sudo ssm list
What has changed?

Next we need to label /dev/vda3 as a physical volumes
$ sudo pvcreate /dev/vda3

$ sudo ssm list

Now we need to add that physical volume to the VolumeGroup (storage pool)

$ sudo vgextend centos_centos2 /dev/vda3
** Make sure your VG name is correct.

$ sudo ssm list
Now we will take some of that space (2G) that we added to the storage pool and use it to create a new logical volume

$ sudo lvcreate -L 2G -n archive centos_centos2
-L size
-n LV name

Now we must format that logical volume with filesystem
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/centos_centos2/archive

$ sudo ssm list

Now we can shrink the size of the LV archive using
$ sudo lvreduce -r -L -0.5G centos_centos2/archive
$ sudo ssm list

***Discuss -r option with images

Now we can increase the size of the LV archive using
$ sudo lvextend -r -L +1G centos_centos2/archive
$ sudo ssm list
