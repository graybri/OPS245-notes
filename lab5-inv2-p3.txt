In this video I will be discussing Lab 5 Investigation 2- Part 3

We will be configuring centos2 to automatically mount the new archive LV on to a new mount point in the filesystem

When we installed centos2 we configured the mount points and their device types and filesystem types.

The Installation program configured centos2 to boot with all of those devices automatically mounted and made available in the filesystem.

The process of mounting in simple terms is to attach a formatted device to a certain mount point within the hierarchical filesystem.
The mount point is just a directory that is almost always empty.

$ sudo ssm list

In the previous part of the lab we created a new LV called archive
But we can see that this logical volume is not mounted anywhere in our filesystem

To manually mount and dismount devices we would use the mount and umount commands

First we need to create a mount point (empty directory)
$ sudo mkdir /archive

$ sudo ls /archive

Now mount the device
$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/centos_centos2/archive /archive
The names do not have to be the same

$ sudo mount
$ sudo ssm list
$ sudo df -h
$ sudo ls /archive

Explain lost+found

Create a file in /archive
First give permissions to other users
$ sudo chmod 777 /archive
$ echo "This is a test file" > /archive/testfile.txt
$ ls /archive

Unmount the device
$ sudo umount /archive
$ ls /archive

$ sudo mount

To have the device automatically mounted when the system boots up we need to edit the filesystem table.
** We must be very careful when editing this file! Errors could leave our system unable to boot!

$ sudo vi /etc/fstab

Add the following line to the bottom of the file

/dev/centos_centos2/archive /archive ext4 defaults 1 2

To then force that new entry to execute use the command
$ sudo mount -a

$ ls /archive

Reboot and check
