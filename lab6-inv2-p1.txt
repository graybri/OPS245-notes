In this video we will be configuring our new virtual network with hostname Resolution

IP networks function by using 32 bit IP addresses to identify a computer on the network.
As humans we will remember names much more easily than numbers so we use hostname and fully qualified domain names to identify computers on the network.
This means that we must have a way of resolving (translating) a hostname to an ip address.
This can be accomplished using an Internet Service called dns
Domain Name Service

DNS consists of a distributed database of FQDN - IP addresses for all registered hosts on the Internet.

## Show Slide
Example of host www.example.com registered with the DNS server that is authoritative for the domain example.com

Discuss recursive-iterative queries and caching

On our virtual network our hosts are NOT registered with an authoritative name server, so we must set up local /etc/hosts files to do name Resolution


from c7host
ping by ip
ping by name

$ cat /etc/hosts
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

on c7host
$ vi /etc/hosts

192.168.245.1	c7host centosmain
192.168.245.11	centos1
192.168.245.12	centos2
192.168.245.13	centos3

$ ping centos1
$ ping centos2
$ ping centos3

$ scp /etc/hosts root@centos1:/etc/
$ scp /etc/hosts root@centos2:/etc/
$ scp /etc/hosts root@centos3:/etc/

demo connection from centos2
