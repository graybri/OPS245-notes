In this video we will review the TCP/IP protocol stack and learn to gather information about our configuration and connectivity

Review both TCP/IP Model images

Troubleshooting and testing network configuration and network services is best done with the TCP/IP architecture in mind and the first step is to understand the protocols and how they work.

Problems using services across a network are not necessarily due to network problems but instead be caused by service configuration issues

On c7host

$ ping centos1
$ ping centos2
$ ping centos3

This verifies that IP and hostname resolution is working
It also means that we successfully resolved the 32 bit IP address to the 48 bit HWaddress or MAC address.
