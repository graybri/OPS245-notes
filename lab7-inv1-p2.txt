Every  time you allow remote access to  a shell you are opening up a possible avenue of attack from hackers

Hackers know that port 22 is commonly open
They also know the root account name.

This makes ssh a target of attack, all that is required is the password.
Brute force attacks could be used.

2 things can make this harder
- Use a non default port number for sshd
- Disable root login over ssh

** On centos1
open terminal
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Look for PermitRootLogin

uncomment and set to no
#PermitRootLogin no

If we are disabling root login we need to make sure that at least one other account is allowed to ssh login
Often we may not want every user to access ssh remotely so we can list users allowed to ssh login

add
AllowUsers bgray

Restart sshd
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd

On c7host
ssh root@centos1
ssh bgray@centos1

On centos1
$ sudo useradd -m other
$ sudo passwd other

on c7host
ssh other@centos1

on centos1
S sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
add other to AllowUsers

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd

on c7host
$ ssh other@centos1

exit

$ ssh bgray@centos1

Backup your sshd_config file to your home directory

$ sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config ~/sshd_config.bk

Make sure all users can read the files

$ chmod go+r  ~/sshd_config.bk

Finally as a sysadmin you should routinely monitor your security logs for unauthorized login attempts

The security log also records all attempts to use su and sudo

$ sudo ls /etc/
$ su -
$ exit

$ sudo less /var/log/secure
G to drop to bottom line

Look for:
ssh connections logins
su usage
sudo usage

$ sudo grep "su :"  /var/log/secure
$ sudo grep "sudo:" /var/log/secure
$ sudo grep "sshd:" /var/log/secure
