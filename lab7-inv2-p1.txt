In this part of the lab we will learn to further configure sshd to allow and use Public/private keys as an authentication method.


From centos3
login as ops245

$ sudo ss -atunp | grep sshd
Note the LISTEN state

ssh into same host

$ ssh ops245@centos3

Explain host authentication message
yes

$ hostname
$ cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts

$ sudo ss -atnp | grep sshd

See ESTABLISHED
$ exit

$ sudo ss -atnp | grep sshd

exit
$ sudo ss -atnp | grep sshd

We may see TIME_WAIT or CLOSED or nothing depending on how fast we were.

Show fingerprint error from lab
Explain host fingerprints(digital sigantures)
If receive fingerpint error
Investigate cause...

If cause is clear and not attempt to spoof the host

$ vi ~/.ssh/known_hosts
delete line

$ ssh ops245@centos3

Accept new fingerprint

Now we will learn to configure sshd to allow the use of Public key Authentication and then generate a pair of keys to be used for logins
Explain PKI authentication.

Configuring ssh to use PKI keys

Used for user Authentication and Host fingerprints
Public/Private keypair encryption.
Used for both privacy and authentication
Asymmetrical encryption.
2 keys are generated (aka a keypair)
Public key
Private key
Both are required.
When we encrypt using Public Key, only the Private Key can decrypt. (Privacy)

When encrypt using Private Key, only the Public Key can decrypt.
(Authentication)

Setup Public key Authentication
In centos2 as REGULAR USER

generate a keypair

$ ssh-keygen

accept filenames
add passphrase
Should be long, hard to guess and easy to remember.

Copy public key to centos3
$ ssh-copy-id  -i  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ops245@centos3

Enter password

ssh ops245@centos3
enter passphrase

$ ls ~/.ssh

logout
