In this part of  the lab we will use an ssh connection to run a Xwindows (graphical) application remotely

Show graphic in wiki

On c7host

as bgray

$ ssh -X -C bgray@centos1

Once connected
$ gedit

The gedit application will display on the local desktop (c7host)
However it is running on centos1 using its CPU and memory resources

$ ps x (on both)

Enter text and save file as Xwindows.txt
Where is the file saved?

Exit gedit

You can also connect and run gedit with a single command

$ ssh -X -C bgray@centos1  gedit

exit
