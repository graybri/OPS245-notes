DHCP

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

Service to configure network hosts with IP address, Subnetmask
Default Gateways, DNS etc.

Configuration information is leased to a client for a certain period after which if it is not renewed it expires.

Much easier way of managing networks and clients than statically configured hosts.
IP address management, and troubleshooting implications.
Critically important for protable devices.

Static hosts still have place.

In lab 6 we statically configured all of our VM's to connect to the same Virtual Network using fixed addresses.

In this lab we will configure one of our hosts to be a DHCP server to provide configuration to the other VM's

The initial DHCP lease process consists of 4 BROADCAST packets between the dhcp client and the dhcp servers.
