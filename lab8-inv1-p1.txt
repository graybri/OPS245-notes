This lab will have us configure our virtual network to use  DHCP to configure our network settings on the hosts on the network

DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

Service to configure network hosts with IP address, Subnet mask
Default Gateways, DNS, and other network settings.

Configuration settings are leased to a client for a certain period after which if it is not renewed it expires.

It is a much easier way of managing networks and clients than statically configured hosts.

It has benefits for IP address management, and troubleshooting.
Critically important for portable devices. (laptops,tablets,phones)

Static hosts still have place. Often network hosts that provide servers, Web server, DNS server etc are usually configured statically.

*** Before we proceed with lab 8 it is important that you have submitted all previous labs.
*** Lab 8 will change some configuration settings that will make the previous lab check scripts fail.

*** Also before starting this lab it is a good idea to perform a yum update and backup all of your VM disk images

In lab 6 we statically configured all of our VM's to connect to the same Virtual Network using fixed addresses.

In this lab we will configure one of our hosts to be a DHCP server to provide configuration to the other VM's

The initial DHCP lease process consists of 4 BROADCAST packets between the dhcp client and the dhcp servers.

Part 1. Installation

Launch c7host and centos3
In centos3

$ rpm -qa dhcp
$ yum install dhcp

To list the files installed by the package:

$ rpm -ql dhcp
Listing files installed by a package after installing it can be very useful, it will help you to know where various config files are stored as well as other useful files

$ cat /etc/dhcp/dhcp.conf

The file is empty so lets make a copy of the .example file and edit it.

$ cp /usr/share/doc/dhcp*/dhcpd.conf.example /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
