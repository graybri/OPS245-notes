In this part of the lab we will find our dhcp lease information on both the client and the server, then we will configure dhcp to provide a permanent ip configuration that is reserved for a specific host (host reservation)

Part 1

on centos3

$ sudo cat /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases

On centos1

$ sudo ls /var/lib/dhclient

if required
$ sudo dhclient eth0

$ sudo cat /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases


Part 2
Now we will configure dhcpd to supply a reserved address to a specific host on the network.

on centos1
Get hardware address of eth0

$ ip address
Make a note
on centos3

$ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

scroll to host declaration for fantasia
The address used must be outside of the Dynamic address range

host centos1 {
	hardware ethernet 52:54:00:60:a8:98;
	fixed-address 192.168.235.42;
}

Restart dhcpd
$ sudo systemctl restart dhcpd

on centos1

$ sudo ifdown eth0
$ sudo ifup eth0

$ ip address
